# Titanic Data Preprocessing

This repository contains the code and files for cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset as part of a machine learning task.

## What I did:
- Imported and explored the dataset
- Handled missing values (Age and Embarked)
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex and Embarked)
- Standardized numerical features (Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch)
- Visualized and removed outliers using boxplots and IQR method
- Prepared the dataset for machine learning models

## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Google Colab (for coding and running the notebook)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Files:
- Titanic_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb : Jupyter/Colab notebook with code and analysis
- titanic.csv : Dataset file (if included)
- screenshots/ : Visuals of plots and outputs (optional)

## Status:
The data cleaning and preprocessing task is completed successfully.

## How to use:
Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and run the cells step-by-step to reproduce the cleaning and preprocessing steps.
